# Encryption Architecture v3

## Changes from v2 to v3

- Introduced asymmetric (ECDH-ES) wrapping layer between
  **prfKey**/**passwordKey** and **mainKey**. This enables **mainKey** to be
  easily rotated as the new key can be re-encrypted under the public key of each
  **prfKey** and **passwordKey**, instead of requiring each **prfKey** and
  **passwordKey** to be available to re-wrap the new **mainKey**.

- **privateKey** now labeled in diagram as "ECDSA secp256r1" instead of "EC
  secp256r1".


## Changes from v1 to v2

- Deleted **outerSessionKey**. **innerSessionKey** is renamed to **sessionKey**
  and is now stored in plaintext in session storage alongside the
  `privateDataJwe` which it encrypts.

- Moved cache of WebAuthn RP ID and user handle from local storage to session storage.

These changes were made in order to support using the app in multiple tabs
signed in to the same account, and to sign out of existing tabs if any tab signs
out or signs in to a different account.


## Encryption Architecture v3

wwWallet uses the [WebAuthn `prf` extension](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#prf-extension)
to derive encryption keys for the wallet contents, including the user's private
proof signing key. This document explains the encryption architecture and its
design rationale, as well as providing critique of the same.

[![Diagram: Wallet encryption architecture](../../../static/img/diagrams/wallet-encryption-architecture-v3.svg)](../../../static/img/diagrams/wallet-encryption-architecture-v3.svg)
<!-- Diagram source: https://drive.google.com/file/d/11WwhOANrvVkPccRf5_uUMU9NaOgyzWN3 -->

The wallet uses the following keys and data types, as labeled in the above diagram:

- `EncryptedContainer`: The user's wallet contents in encrypted form. This is
  stored both in the backend server database, and downloaded to the client's
  [local storage][localStorage] when the user signs in to the wallet.

- `PrivateData`: The cleartext contents of an `EncryptedContainer`. This
  contains both sensitive data, namely **privateKey**, and non-sensitive data,
  including the user's DID and public proof signing key. All of these contents
  are encrypted at rest on both the server side and the client side.

- `EphemeralEncapsulationInfo`: An ephemeral ECDH public key and auxiliary
  parameters to use for unwrapping the **mainKey** used to encrypt the
  `EncryptedContainer`. This is shared between all **prfKey**s and
  **passwordKey**s in the `EncryptedContainer`.

- `StaticEncapsulationInfo`: A wrapped copy of the **mainKey** along with a
  static ECDH key pair **wrapPublicKey** and **wrapPrivateKey**. This is unique
  per **prfKey** and **passwordKey**. The ECDH private key is in turn wrapped by
  the associated **prfKey** or **passwordKey**.

  When creating a new **mainKey**, a new **ephPublicKey** and **ephPrivateKey**
  pair is created and each `StaticEncapsulationInfo` is updated as follows. An
  ECDH exchange is made between **ephPrivateKey** and the **wrapPublicKey** of
  the `StaticEncapsulationInfo`. The resulting **wrappingKey** is used to wrap
  the new **mainKey**, and the resulting wrapping is stored in the
  `StaticEncapsulationInfo`. Finally, the **ephPublicKey** is stored in the
  `EphemeralEncapsulationInfo` of the `EncryptedContainer` and the
  **ephPrivateKey** is discarded.

  During sign-in, the user chooses a **prfKey** or **passwordKey** which is used
  to unwrap the **wrapPrivateKey** stored in the associated
  `StaticEncapsulationInfo`. The opposite ECDH exchange is made between
  **wrapPrivateKey** and the stored **ephPublicKey** to derive the
  **wrappingKey** used to unwrap the **mainKey** stored in the
  `StaticEncapsulationInfo`, and finally **mainKey** is used to decrypt the
  `EncryptedContainer`.

- **privateKey**: The user's proof signing secp256r1 private key. This is the
  long-lived key that is used to prove the user's ownership of the wallet. This
  key is generated once, as part of creating the user's wallet when they first
  create a wwWallet account.

  The **privateKey** member of `PrivateData` is encrypted an additional time
  using the same encryption key.

  **privateKey** is only kept in volatile memory, and is never written to
  persistent storage in unencrypted form.

- **mainKey**: The 256-bit AES-GCM encryption key of the `EncryptedContainer`.
  This is used to decrypt the contained `PrivateData` and is itself stored in
  encrypted (wrapped) form in the `EncryptedContainer`, asymmetrically encrypted
  using each of the user's **prfKey**s and, if applicable, **passwordKey**.

  This key is generated as part of creating the user's wallet when they first
  create a wwWallet account, but may be replaced at any time.

  **mainKey** is only kept in volatile memory, and is never written to
  persistent storage in unencrypted form.

- **prfKey**: A 256-bit AES-GCM encryption key derived using the WebAuthn `prf`
  extension. This is used to wrap and unwrap an associated
  `StaticEncapsulationInfo` structure in order to decrypt the
  `EncryptedContainer` contents during sign-in.

  The user may have 0 or more instances of **prfKey** (or at least 1, when
  password authentication is disabled), each corresponding to a WebAuthn
  credential the user may use to sign in to the backend service. Each **prfKey**
  has its own unique associated `StaticEncapsulationInfo`.

  The **prfSalt** and HKDF parameters used to derive **prfKey** are randomly
  generated once, when the corresponding WebAuthn credential is registered.

  **prfKey** is only kept in volatile memory, and is never written to persistent
  storage.

- **passwordKey**: A 256-bit AES-GCM encryption key derived from a password
  using PBKDF2. This is a legacy feature that is usually disabled. Like
  **prfKey**, this is used to wrap and unwrap an associated
  `StaticEncapsulationInfo` structure in order to decrypt the
  `EncryptedContainer` contents during sign-in. The **passwordKey** has its own
  unique associated `StaticEncapsulationInfo`.

  The PBKDF2 salt used to derive **passwordKey** is randomly generated once,
  when the account is created. Changing the password is not possible as of this
  writing.

  **passwordKey** is only kept in volatile memory, and is never written to
  persistent storage.

- **wrapPrivateKey** and **wrapPublicKey**: The static ECDH keypair of a
  `StaticEncapsulationInfo`. These are used to perform an ECDH exchange with the
  **ephPublicKey** or **ephPrivateKey**, respectively, to derive the
  **wrappingKey** used to decrypt or encrypt the **mainKey**.

  Each **wrapPrivateKey** is only kept in volatile memory, and is never written
  to persistent storage in unencrypted form. Each **wrapPublicKey** is stored in
  cleartext in the `StaticEncapsulationInfo`.

- **ephPrivateKey** and **ephPublicKey**: An ephemeral ECDH keypair for wrapping
  the **mainKey**. These are used to perform an ECDH exchange with a
  **wrapPublicKey** or **wrapPrivateKey**, respectively, to derive the
  **wrappingKey** used to decrypt or encrypt the **mainKey**.

  **ephPublicKey** is stored as an `EphemeralEncapsulationInfo` structure in the
  `EncryptedContainer`. **ephPrivateKey** is only kept in volatile memory, and
  is discarded after wrapping the **mainKey**.

- **sessionKey**: A 256-bit AES-GCM encryption key used to decrypt the
  `EncryptedContainer` for the duration of a session.

  Upon successful sign-in, the `EncryptedContainer` is first decrypted using
  **mainKey** as described above. The `PrivateData` is then re-encrypted using a
  newly generated **sessionKey**, resulting in the ciphertext `privateDataJwe`
  which is stored in the client's [session storage][sessionStorage]. The
  **sessionKey** is also stored in cleartext session storage alongside the
  `privateDataJwe`.


## Design rationale

The primary concerns during the development of this design was to keep all key
material on the client side, and to minimize the exposure of long-lived secrets.
Thus we keep the wallet contents encrypted at rest, and introduced the session
keys by the following rationale.


### Re-encrypting wallet contents to a session key

This is a vestigial feature from the v1 and v2 architecture iterations where
**mainKey** was a long-lived key that was not easily replaceable. The
**sessionKey** was therefore used to minimize the exposure of the **mainKey**.

This v3 architecture revision allows for frequently rotating the **mainKey**,
but we keep the **sessionKey** for now since rotation of **mainKey** is not yet
implemented.


### Selection of client-side storage areas

We use the [Web Crypto API][webcrypto] for encryption, decryption and key
management operations. The `CryptoKey` objects do not survive page reload or
top-level navigation unless stored in some persistent storage. We use two
client-side storage areas: [local storage][localStorage] and [session
storage][sessionStorage].

#### Local storage

We store the `EncryptedContainer` in [local storage][localStorage] in
anticipation of the possibility to use the wallet in offline mode in the future.
We also cache some other parameters:

- The **prfKey** derivation parameters for each user that has logged in on the
  machine, and a display name for the user. These are used to eliminate the need
  for the user to authenticate twice to sign in to the wallet: once to retrieve
  the `EncryptedContainer`, including the PRF salts used to derive a **prfKey**,
  and once to evaluate the PRF with the retrieved salt. The cached salt allows
  both of these steps to be performed in a single WebAuthn authentication
  ceremony. The user may delete any entry of this cache while logged out.

- The user's WebAuthn user handle, needed to detect if the user signs in to a
  different account in a different browser tab and log out of the older tab in
  that case.


#### Session storage

We store the **sessionKey** and re-encrypted `privateDataJwe` in [session
storage][sessionStorage] so that they expire when the user closes the browser
tab. We also cache some other parameters:

- The WebAuthn RP ID for the wwWallet service, needed to derive **prfKey**s.
  This could be a configuration constant of the frontend app, but the backend
  already sends it during the initial authentication or signup, so we cache the
  value and eliminate the possibility of config mismatch.

- The user's WebAuthn user handle, needed to detect if the user signs in to a
  different account in a different browser tab and log out of the older tab in
  that case.


### Encrypting **privateKey** twice

Since **privateKey** is more sensitive than other members of `PrivateData`,
we encrypt it an additional time so that we can access the other members of
`PrivateData` without exposing **privateKey** in cleartext unnecessarily.


### Using **prfKey** and **passwordKey** to wrap en ECDH private key

The [`deriveKey()`][derive-key] function in WebCrypto does not support deriving
an ECDH private key deterministically, for example from PRF output or from an
PBKDF2 output key. Therefore we instead have to generate the ECDH key pair
nondeterministically and store the wrapped private key.


## Critique

This design has some drawbacks, and some of the intended advantages are
debatable. The following critique may inform a revised design. This is not
exhaustive; we invite additional and ongoing review and critique of the design.


### Cleartext session key

The **sessionKey** is used for user convenience: once logged in, the session key
can be used for the duration of the session to access encrypted data. However,
this might not improve security much; with **mainKey** now easily replaceable it
is not materially less secure to simply store the **mainKey** itself in
cleartext in session storage.


### Weak encryption at rest

Although the `EncryptedContainer` itself is stored in encrypted form, we also
store all encryption keys needed to decrypt it. This means that the encryption
at rest is at best a "security by obscurity" measure or, more charitably, a
dubious form of "defense in depth". It would thus be preferable to retrieve or
derive the encryption keys from data not stored in cleartext on the client
device.

The session keys could be eliminated in favour of simply re-deriving the
**prfKey** or **passwordKey** whenever sensitive contents need to be accessed.
This would require the user to perform an authentication ceremony (presenting a
WebAuthn credential or entering a password) for each access. This may or may not
be an acceptable user experience. The keys could be kept in application memory
for a short time to avoid bursts of multiple authentication prompts during a
single semantic user action. In fact the app already does this when adding or
deleting WebAuthn credentials, which each need a corresponding **prfKey**.


### Encrypting **privateKey** twice

Likewise, encrypting **privateKey** twice may not materially improve security
either. An adversary with read access to the other `PrivateData` members will
likely also have read access to both of local storage and session storage, thus
having access to the keys needed to decrypt **privateKey** anyway.


### **passwordKey** is not entirely client-side

When a **passwordKey** is used, the key material and algorithm parameters needed
to derive **passwordKey** are exposed to the backend service. To make
**passwordKey** entirely client-side, making it impossible for the backend
service to access the contents of the `EncryptedContainer`, a different
passphrase should be used to derive **passwordKey** than is used to sign in to
the backend service. Alternatively, some password blinding method such as a
[PAKE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement)
protocol might be used to keep the backend server from learning the user's
password.


### Software keys, not hardware keys

All cryptographic keys used by wwWallet are fundamentally software keys, held in
browser memory. This is due to technical limitations, some of which may change
in the future.

However, note the difference between encryption keys and signing keys.
Encryption and decryption inherently involves exposing the cleartext anyway, so
encryption keys do not need to be kept secret from parties accessing the
cleartext.

The WebAuthn `prf` extension simply returns pseudo-random data which wwWallet
uses to derive encryption keys. Thus the encryption keys are software keys held
by the browser, but the WebAuthn authenticator holding the PRF key is needed in
order to access the PRF outputs. This is sufficient hardware binding for
encryption keys, assuming the browser is benevolent.

Ideally the user's **privateKey** should be a hardware-bound key, so that even
if the **mainKey** or the `PrivateData` is exposed, an unauthorized party would
still not be able to sign proofs on behalf of the legitimate user. This is not
currently possible due to technical limitations. Although WebAuthn
authentication keys may be hardware-bound, they do not support signing arbitrary
data. Future extensions to the WebAuthn API might add the possibility to sign
arbitrary data with a hardware-bound private key.
