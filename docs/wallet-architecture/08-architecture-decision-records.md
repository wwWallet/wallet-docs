# Architecture Decision Records
Architecturally significant decisions regarding the wwWallet stack are being tracked using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) on version control. Those significant decisions include those that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques.

An ADR is a short document written in Markdown, kept under [/wallet-docs/docs/category/architecture-decision-records-archive](/wallet-docs/docs/category/architecture-decision-records-archive), numbered sequentially and monotonically. If a decision is reversed, relevant ADR is marked as superseded and points to the newest decision.

ADRs in wwWallet are built around these sections:
* Title
* Context
* Decision
* Status
* Consequences

Subsections can be used when needed. It is recommended that ADRs do not exceed one page.
The semantics of each of the main sections are based on [Documenting Architecture Decisions](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) by Michael Nygard.
