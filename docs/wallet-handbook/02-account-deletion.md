# Account Deletion

If you wish to delete your wallet account, follow these steps.

## Steps to Delete Your Account

1. **Log In to Your Wallet**
   - Open your wwWallet app or [wwallet.org](https://wwallet.org) on your browser and sign in to your account.

2. **Go to Settings**
   - Once logged in, navigate to the **Settings** section in the wallet.

3. **Unlock the "Manage Account" Section**
   - In Settings, locate the **Manage Account** section. You may need to unlock this section by using your passkey.

4. **Select "Delete Account"**
   - Within the Manage Account options, choose **Delete Account**.

5. **Confirm Deletion**
   - A confirmation prompt will appear. Carefully review the prompt, and if youâ€™re sure, confirm your decision to delete your account.

> **Note**: If you have deleted the wwWallet app, you can re-install it or visit [wwallet.org](https://wwallet.org) to sign in. You will have to use the same passkey that you initially created the account with, or any passkey that you have added to your account. This will restore access to your wallet.
