# Privacy Policy

The wallet is designed with privacy and security as top priorities, ensuring that users have complete control over their data. Here’s how we protect your privacy:

## Key Pairs and Encryption

- In its current phase, wwWallet enhances privacy by generating unique, unrelated key pairs for each credential. This ensures that cryptographic keys do not compromise unlinkability, preventing tracking by relying parties, provided the holder does not use the same credential instance for every presentation. All key pairs are stored securely on the user's device in an encrypted format.

## Data Sharing

- No data is shared with third parties unless the user explicitly chooses to do so. For example, this might occur as part of **Verifiable Credentials (VCs) presentation flows**.
- This approach allows the user full control over their data, sharing only when and with whom they choose.

## Our Commitment to Privacy

This privacy-focused design ensures that all user data remains private, safeguarded and entirely under the user’s control. We’re committed to maintaining this approach as we continue to develop and enhance the wallet.
