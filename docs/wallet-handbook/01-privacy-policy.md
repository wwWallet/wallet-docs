# Privacy Policy

The wallet is designed with privacy and security as top priorities, ensuring that users have complete control over their data. Here’s how we protect your privacy:

## Data Storage and Encryption

- All user data is stored securely on the user's device in an encrypted format. This means that only the user has access to their data, and it cannot be viewed or accessed by anyone else.

## Role of the Wallet Provider

- The Wallet Provider’s backend services are designed solely to provide auxiliary support, such as encrypted backup storage. 
- **Important:** These services function without ever accessing or processing any unencrypted user information, ensuring that the user's data remains private.

## Data Sharing

- No data is shared with third parties unless the user explicitly chooses to do so. For example, this might occur as part of **Verifiable Credentials (VCs) presentation flows**.
- This approach allows the user full control over their data, sharing only when and with whom they choose.

## Our Commitment to Privacy

This privacy-focused design ensures that all user data remains private, safeguarded and entirely under the user’s control. We’re committed to maintaining this approach as we continue to develop and enhance the wallet.
